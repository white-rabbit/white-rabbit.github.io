[Shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) is an excellent tool not only to
experiment with shaders but in some cases even do real art!
You can easily verify this by viewing the most rated shaders!

It's especially funny sometimes
to look at the code and see that some amazingly expressive pictures
were created with just 200-300 lines of code! Although be careful, sometimes
there is more code, since it uses offscreen rendering into intermediate buffers :sweat_smile:

Looking at some of them, I am sometimes amazed how the
human brain can even come up with such a thing!

I also have a page on [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/savegor).
These are usually small experiments with physics.

But, for example, I implemented the Conway's Game of Life:
{{< shadertoy id="3tSyWm" >}}

As you can see with shadertoy you can easily do some tricks,
like displaying the Game of Life on the Voronoi's grid.
The cells in this representation are even more ... well... alive :wink: :

{{< shadertoy id="WsdcWN" >}}

I seriously doubt that the idea of making such a mix ever
occurred to me without this amazing tool!

I highly recommend to try it!
