Computational instability is the thing that reveals the irreducable gap between
a mathematical model and a simulation. A mathematical model can describe a really
complex system, but there is usually no analytical solution...
The only way available to us is numerical simulation. It alows us to see the shadow
of the model, but never - the model itself. It usually enough, but it is never real.
