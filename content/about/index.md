# Hello, friend

...and welcome!

## About me

I am one of those who loves math, physics, programming etc.
In general - the standard set of a person fascinated by the rapid
flight of humanity into a technological singularity.

I really love travelling, cycling, cooking, playing board
games and learning new things.

The significant part of my life is my family...

What else?

I am a music lover :headphones:.
Even used to play the drums... but I couldn't stick with it (ba dum tss :drum:).

Books were my best friends when I was a kid (that is expected, right?).

Oh, and I've been told I look like a raccoon (do I?).

## Experience
My journey to software development has been a winding path,
but I'm grateful for the diverse experiences that have
enriched my perspective. At least I like to think this way :smiling_face:

I received a Master's degree in Computer Science and Applied Mathematics.
I loved numerical methods, mathematical modeling and coding and suddenly discovered
that I could apply all of it in the physics department. Long story short I spent
several years there working on a software package for nanostructure modeling and
eventually even got a PhD :nerd_face:

I also became seriously interested in computer graphics,
which ultimately led me to game development industry. There I gained
a lot of interesting practical experience and ... yes..
I definitely got to know what crunch is...

Now I am a backend developer and mostly focused on real-time data
analytics pipeline.

Participated in several [video game creating jams](https://ldjam.com/users/savegor/games).

Love [shadertoy](https://www.shadertoy.com/user/savegor).

Lately I started enjoying Rust.
